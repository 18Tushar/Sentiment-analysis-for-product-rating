## üìä Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to classify the sentiment in a given text, such as customer reviews. This project focuses on **classifying product reviews** and linking them with corresponding product ratings (typically ranging from 1-5 stars). It uses machine learning models to predict the sentiment of reviews, which in turn correlates with product ratings.

**Key Objectives**:
- Preprocess customer review data.
- Perform sentiment classification using various machine learning models.
- Predict product ratings based on the review sentiment.

## üöÄ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes the raw text data from customer reviews.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Uses ML models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks for sentiment classification.
- **Rating Prediction**: Maps sentiment scores to product ratings (1 to 5 stars).
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes sentiment distribution, word clouds, and model performance metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes unwanted characters, punctuation, and stopwords.
- **Tokenization**: Breaks reviews into words or tokens.
- **Lemmatization**: Converts words to their root forms.
- **Vectorization**: Transforms text into numerical data using techniques like TF-IDF or Word2Vec.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Supervised Learning Models**: Implement models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or LSTMs
- Train the models on labeled review data to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

### 3. **Rating Prediction**
- **Mapping Sentiment to Ratings**: Use the sentiment results (positive, negative, neutral) to predict corresponding product ratings (1-5 stars).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the prediction accuracy using metrics like:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**

### 4. **Data Visualization**
- Visualize key metrics:
  - Distribution of positive, neutral, and negative reviews.
  - Word clouds for frequently used words in each sentiment category.
  - Confusion matrices to show model performance.

## üìù Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of product reviews, which typically include:
- **Review Text**: The actual customer feedback in textual form.
- **Review Rating**: A rating from 1 to 5 stars.
- **Other Features**: Product details, user ID, timestamp (if applicable).
